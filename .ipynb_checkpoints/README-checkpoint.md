This workshop assignment revolves around analyzing data and fitting distributions. You will choose between one of two datasets: the compressive strength of concrete, or air temperatures near Delft. In this workshop, you will analyze and plot the dataset, then fit a distribution by hand, and visually analyze the fit of your chosen distribution.
